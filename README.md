## Package Jira-helper

A command line tool for easily creating/updating JIRA tasks in batch.

It is based on Chrome Puppeteer which is an Web application end-to-end automation test tool engine.
In this way, We don't need to rely on JIRA restful API.

### Roadmap:
Support sync JIRA with Trello board.
